PayME SDK is a set of libraries for apps to interact with PayME Platform. PayME SDK includes the following main functions:

- Registration, login, eKYC system through PayME wallet account

- Deposit and withdrawal function from PayME wallet.

- Integration of services of PayME Platform.

## Install
- npm:
```shell
npm install expo-payme-sdk
```

- yarn:
```shell
yarn add expo-payme-sdk
```

## Install dependent library

```shell
expo install expo-contacts
```

## Usage

The PayME system will provide the integrated app with the following information:

- **PublicKey** : Used to encrypt data, the integrated app needs to be transmitted to the SDK for encryption.

- **AppToken** : AppToken provides a separate identifier for each app, needs to be passed to the SDK for encryption

- **SecretKey** : Used to encrypt and authenticate data in the backend system for the integrated app.

The App side will provide the PayME system with the following information:

- **AppPublicKey** : It will be sent through PayME's backend system for encryption.

- **AppPrivateKey**: Will pass in PayME SDK to perform decryption.

Encryption standard: RSA-512bit.

### Initializing the library

Before using the PayME SDK, you need to import the ExpoPaymeSDK Component and pass the ref to initialize and use.

```javascript
import ExpoPaymeSDK from 'expo-payme-sdk';

export default function App() {
  const refExpoPaymeSDK = React.useRef(null);
  return
  (
    <>
      ...
      <RootNavigation />
      ...
      <ExpoPaymeSDK ref={refExpoPaymeSDK}  />
      </>
  )
}
```

### Functions of PayME SDK
Before using PayME SDK need to call login() :

#### login

There are 2 cases

- Used to login for the first time immediately after initializing PayME.

- Used when the accessToken expires, when calling the SDK function that returns the error code ERROR_CODE.EXPIRED, now the app needs to call login again to get the accessToken for other functions.

After calling login() successfully, then call other functions of the SDK ( openWallet, pay, ... )

```javascript
const configs = {
	connectToken,
	appToken,
	deviceId,
	env,
	configColor,
	publicKey,
	privateKey,
	appID,
	phone
}
refExpoPaymeSDK.current.login(
  configs,
  onSuccess: (response: any) => void,
  onError: (error: any) => void,
)
```

#### Constant

| Property | Type | Description |
| ------------------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| `ENV.SANDBOX` | `enum` | Sandbox environment. |
| `ENV.PRODUCTION` | `enum` | Production environment. |

#### Parameters

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `appToken` | `string` | AppId provides a unique identifier for each app, which needs to be passed to the SDK for encryption. |
| `publicKey` | `string` | For data encryption, the built-in app needs to pass it to the SDK for encryption. Due to the PayME system provided for the integrated app. |
| `privateKey` | `string` | app needs to pass in to decode the data. The app side will provide the PayME system. |
| `connectToken` | `string` | app needs to pass the value given above, see how to create it below. |
| `deviceId` | `string` | Is the deviceId of the device |
| `appID` | `string` | Is the appID when registering merchant sdk will be generated by the system for |
| `phone` | `string` | Phone number of the system integrator |
| `configColor` | `string[]` | configColor : is the color parameter to be able to change the color of PayME wallet transactions, the data type is string with

configColor : is the color parameter to be able to change the color of PayME wallet transactions, the data type is string with the format #rrggbb. If 2 colors are transmitted, the PayME interface will gradient according to the 2 input colors.

How to create **connectToken**:

connectToken needed for transmission call the api from to PayME and will be generated from the backend of the integrated app. The structure is as follows:

- ***Nodejs Example***

```javascript
import crypto from 'crypto'

const data = {
	timestamp: "2021-01-20T06:53:07.621Z",
	userId: "abc",
	phone: "0123456789"
}
const algorithm = `aes-256-cbc`
const ivbyte = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
const iv = Buffer.from(ivbyte)

const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, secretKey, iv)

const encrypted = cipher.update(JSON.stringify(data), 'utf8', 'base64')

const connectToken = encrypted + cipher.final('base64')
```

- ***Expo Example***

```javascript
import forge from 'node-forge'

function encryptAES(text, secretKey) {
  const ivbyte = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  const cipher = forge.cipher.createCipher('AES-CBC', secretKey)
  cipher.start({ iv: ivbyte })
  cipher.update(forge.util.createBuffer(text, 'utf8'))
  cipher.finish()
  return forge.util.encode64(cipher.output.getBytes())
}

const data = {
  timestamp: "2021-01-20T06:53:07.621Z",
	userId: "abc",
	phone: "0123456789"
};

const connectToken = encryptAES(JSON.stringify(data), appSecretkey)
```

Generate connectToken including KYC information (For partners with their own KYC system)

```javascript
const data = {
  timestamp: "2021-01-20T06:53:07.621Z",
  userId : "abc",
  phone : "0123456789",
  kycInfo: {
    fullname: "Nguyễn Văn A",
    gender: "MALE",
    birthday: "1995-01-20T06:53:07.621Z",
    address: "15 Nguyễn cơ thạch",
    identifyType: "CMND",
    identifyNumber: "142744332",
    issuedAt: "2013-01-20T06:53:07.621Z",
    placeOfIssue: "Hồ Chí Minh",
    video: "https://file-examples-com.github.io/uploads/2017/04/file_example_MP4_480_1_5MG.mp4",
    face: "https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/04/23/22/00/tree-736885__480.jpg",

      back: "https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/04/23/22/00/tree-736885__480.jpg"
    }
  }
};

const connectToken = encryptAES(JSON.stringify(data), appSecretkey)
```

| **Parameters** | **Required** | **Explanation** |
| :----------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **timestamp** | Yes | The time of creating connectToken in the format iSO 8601 , Used to determine the timeout time of connectToken. Example 2021-01-20T06:53:07,621Z |

| ***phone*** | No | Phone number of the system integrator |

Where ***AES*** is the encryption function according to the AES algorithm. Depending on the language on the server, the system side uses the corresponding library. See more here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard

In case the built-in app needs to get the balance to display itself on the UI on the app, you can use the function, this function does not display the UI of the PayME SDK.
- When paying with PayME wallet, it is required that the activated account, identifier and balance in the wallet must be greater than the payment amount
- Account information is obtained through the getAccountInfo() function
- Balance information is obtained through the getWalletInfo function ()



#### getWalletInfo - Get wallet information
